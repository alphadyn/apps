# Fractal Atlas Web App

**Deployed application:** [Open the app](https://alphadyn.github.io/apps/fractal-patterns/)

> Standalone interactive visualization. See the [repository catalog](../README.md) for shared setup and deployment context.

A browser-based web app that generates and displays 10 popular fractal patterns on an HTML canvas.

## Features

- Interactive fractal renderer using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 canvas
- 10 fractal patterns in one app
- Pattern selector and random pattern button
- Adjustable detail slider per fractal
- Zoom controls, mouse-wheel zoom, and drag-to-pan
- Mobile touch gestures: one-finger pan and pinch-to-zoom
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

## Included Fractal Patterns

1. Mandelbrot Set
2. Julia Set
3. Newton Fractal
4. Sierpinski Triangle
5. Sierpinski Carpet
6. Koch Snowflake
7. Dragon Curve
8. Barnsley Fern
9. Fractal Tree
10. Cantor Set

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main page markup
- `styles.css` - App styling and responsive layout
- `app.js` - Fractal generation and rendering logic

## How To Run

No build tools or installation are required.

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Select a fractal pattern from the dropdown.
3. Adjust the detail slider.
4. Click **Render** to generate the fractal.
5. Optionally click **Random Pick** to explore patterns quickly.

## Navigation Controls

- **Zoom In / Zoom Out** buttons adjust scale around the center.
- **Mouse wheel** zooms in and out around the cursor position.
- **Click and drag** on the canvas to pan.
- **Reset View** returns to default zoom and center.
- **Hide Controls / Show Controls** toggles a near full-screen canvas mode and remembers your preference.
- On touch devices:
	- **One finger drag** pans.
	- **Pinch gesture** zooms in and out.

## Notes

- Some fractals are computationally heavier at higher detail levels and may take longer to render.
- Rendering behavior and speed can vary by browser and hardware.

## Test the project

Run the repository-wide test suite from the project root:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```
