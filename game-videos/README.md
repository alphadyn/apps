# Game Videos Site

**Deployed application:** [Open the app](https://alphadyn.github.io/apps/game-videos/)

> Standalone static media showcase. See the [repository catalog](../README.md) for shared setup and deployment context.

This folder contains a simple static website that showcases a collection of gaming video links.

## What is included
- A single-page HTML layout in `index.html`
- A curated list of game categories with links to video content

## How to view it
Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the page.

## Notes
- This is a lightweight demo site with no backend or dependencies.
- It is useful as a simple example of a content-focused landing page.

## Test the project
Run the repository-wide test suite from the project root:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

## Generate the report
Run the generator script to create a simple HTML output:

```bash
python3 generate_report.py
```

This writes [generated_report.html](generated_report.html) in the same folder.
