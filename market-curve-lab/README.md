# Market Curve Lab

**Deployed application:** [Open the app](https://alphadyn.github.io/apps/market-curve-lab/)

> Vercel-hosted market analysis app with a static GitHub Pages entrypoint. See the [repository catalog](../README.md) and [deployment guide](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for shared context.

A web app that loads all 500 members of the current S&P 500 index, ranks them by market capitalization, and lets you search for any other listed equity by ticker or company name. Market caps come from Nasdaq's paginated public screener joined to the current S&P constituent list. Multiple share classes are combined by issuer and represented by the class with the largest reported market cap. If market cap is unavailable, the member remains in the list at the bottom; Brown–Forman currently has no screener value. Search results and adjusted monthly price history come from Yahoo Finance.

For the selected company, the app plots split- and dividend-adjusted total performance from a $100 starting value, overlays linear and quadratic least-squares trendlines, compares model fit using R², and reports recent concavity based on a quadratic fit to the latest 24 monthly observations. The full S&P 500 is ranked when the app loads; historical prices and curve analysis are fetched only for the selected ticker.

## Shared results cache

Page loads read the S&P 500 ranking and each ticker's analysis from a shared Supabase table ([`supabase-schema.sql`](supabase-schema.sql)) instead of recomputing them, so visiting the page doesn't re-rank the index or re-fetch price history every time. A newly searched ticker that isn't cached yet is fetched once and saved for later visitors. The "Refresh data" button next to the ticker card bypasses the cache and recomputes the current ranking and selected ticker, overwriting the saved rows. The loading panel shows progress through these steps (checking saved results, loading rankings/history, fitting trendlines).

## Security URLs and link previews

Every security has its own URL: `?symbol=<TICKER>` (for example
`https://alphadyn.github.io/apps/market-curve-lab/?symbol=NVDA`). Picking a stock
updates the address bar, and the browser's back and forward buttons move between
securities you've viewed.

The **Share** button copies (or opens the system share sheet for) an Alphadyn
permalink such as `https://alphadyn.github.io/apps/market-curve-lab/s/NVDA/` for
S&P 500 constituents. That ticker-specific page shows Alphadyn as the preview
domain and redirects visitors to
`https://alphadyn.github.io/apps/market-curve-lab/?symbol=NVDA`. Other listed
stocks use the Vercel dynamic preview URL because GitHub Pages has no generated
page for them.
Link previews don't run JavaScript, and GitHub Pages returns the same static tags
for every query string, so the Pages workflow runs
[`build_share_pages.py`](build_share_pages.py) to generate a crawler-readable
page for every S&P 500 constituent (the generated `s/` folder is not committed).
Each page has Open Graph and Twitter tags with the security's name and S&P rank,
plus its total return, best fit, and concavity when saved results exist. Pages
then send visitors to the app with that ticker selected. Each preview image is
rendered per ticker by Vercel.

That endpoint builds ticker-specific Open Graph metadata and a 1200×630 PNG chart
on demand per ticker through
[`api/share.js`](api/share.js) on Vercel (`/s/<TICKER>/preview.png`, rendered with
`@vercel/og`), because GitHub Pages can't render images. That endpoint also serves
a Vercel-hosted preview page at `/s/<TICKER>` for any listed ticker. Previews use
the shared Supabase cache when it has data and otherwise fetch the price history
live.

## Deployment

`index.html` is the static web app entry point. The [`api/`](api/) directory contains Vercel serverless functions for company data, search, and analysis. GitHub Pages serves the static frontend and calls the configured Vercel API because market-data providers do not allow browser cross-origin requests. The frontend uses `/api/market-curve-lab` on Vercel and the configured root-project API on `github.io`.

The repository-root Vercel project exposes the market-data API at `/api/market-curve-lab/*`; the GitHub Pages frontend calls that API because market-data providers do not allow browser cross-origin requests. The repository's GitHub Pages deployment publishes this directory as part of the static site. Deploy this directory separately with Vercel only when its share-preview routes are needed; see the root [deployment guide](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for details.

## Method

- **Performance:** Yahoo Finance adjusted monthly close, rebased to $100 at the first available observation. The chart uses a logarithmic vertical scale so the full history remains readable.
- **Trendlines:** Linear and quadratic ordinary least-squares fits are calculated over log-transformed monthly performance, matching the chart's logarithmic vertical scale. The model with higher R² is identified as the closest-fitting full-period trendline.
- **Current concavity:** A quadratic least-squares fit over the latest 24 monthly observations is concave up when its second-order coefficient is positive and concave down when negative. This describes recent historical curvature; it is not a forecast.

The company list is joined to Nasdaq's paginated market-cap screener; market caps are indicative and can be delayed or unavailable. Company price histories are fetched on selection rather than issuing hundreds of historical-price requests at startup. This educational visualization is not investment advice. Historical data can be revised or unavailable, and provider endpoints can change.
