# Meetings — Video Conferencing App

**Deployed application:** [Open the app](https://alphadyn.github.io/apps/meetings/)

> Browser-based WebRTC meeting app with mobile controls. See the [repository catalog](../README.md) for shared setup and deployment context.

A browser-based video conferencing app. Enter a name and a meeting code to join a room where
participants can talk, video chat, message each other, and share files — all peer-to-peer, with
no application server required, and all strongly encrypted end-to-end.

## Features
- **Audio & video** calling between all participants using WebRTC, with mic/camera mute toggles
  and a camera preview before joining
- **Text chat** sent over a WebRTC data channel to everyone currently in the meeting
- **File sharing** (up to 25 MB) — send a file and everyone in the meeting gets a direct download
  link
- **Strong end-to-end encryption**: audio and video are protected by WebRTC's mandatory
  DTLS-SRTP transport encryption, and chat, file transfers, and all room signaling are separately
  encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a key derived (via PBKDF2, 150,000 iterations) from the
  meeting code — see Encryption below for details
- **Mesh topology**: the first participant to join a meeting code becomes its lightweight
  directory (introducing new joiners to everyone already present); every participant then holds a
  direct connection to every other participant, so media/chat/files never pass through a central
  server
- **Invite links**: "Copy invite link" puts a URL with `?room=<code>` on the clipboard so others
  can join the same meeting with one click
- **Fullscreen mode**: expand the meeting view and exit fullscreen with the toolbar control
- **Mobile-friendly layout**: responsive video tiles, touch-sized controls, and an overlay panel
  for chat, people, and files on smaller screens
- Participant list with live join/leave updates

## Run it
This app uses [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/) (loaded from a CDN) for WebRTC signaling via its free
public cloud broker, so an internet connection is required, along with browser permission to use
the camera and microphone. Camera/microphone access requires a secure context: use HTTPS when
deployed, or serve the folder on localhost while developing:

```bash
cd meetings
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser. To test locally with multiple participants, open
the same meeting code in separate browser tabs, windows, or devices.

## How to use
1. Enter your name and a meeting code. Click **Generate a new code** to create one, then click
  **Join meeting**.
2. Grant camera/microphone permission when prompted. The app waits for your device permissions
  before starting the meeting; if one device is unavailable, the other can still work. If you
  change browser permissions or connect a device, click **Retry camera / microphone** on the
  join screen. You can also join without either device to use chat and files.
3. Use the control bar to mute your mic, stop your camera, open **Chat**, view **People**, share
  **Files**, enter or exit **Fullscreen**, or **Leave** the meeting. On phones, the toolbar and
  side panel adapt to the smaller screen.
4. Click **Copy invite link** and send it to others so they can join the same meeting instantly.

## Main files
- `index.html` — join screen and in-meeting layout (video grid, chat/people/files panel, controls)
- `app.js` — PeerJS-based mesh signaling, media/data connection handling, chat, file transfer, and
  the AES-256-GCM encryption layer
- `styles.css` — layout and visual styling

## Encryption
- **Audio & video**: WebRTC mandates DTLS-SRTP for every peer connection, so calls are always
  encrypted in transit browser-to-browser — this can't be disabled and requires no extra setup.
- **Chat, files, and signaling**: every data-channel message (chat text, file bytes, and the
  join/roster messages used to introduce participants) is additionally encrypted with
  AES-256-GCM before it's sent. The key is derived from the meeting code using PBKDF2 (SHA-256,
  150,000 iterations) via the browser's Web Crypto API, so only participants who know the meeting
  code can decrypt this traffic, not the PeerJS signaling broker or any network relay in between.
  Each message uses a fresh random 96-bit IV.
- **Peer identity**: the meeting's directory peer ID is a SHA-256 hash of the meeting code rather
  than the code itself, so the plaintext meeting code is never sent to the public signaling
  server.
- This design keeps the same trust model as the app itself: whoever has the meeting code can join
  the meeting and decrypt its traffic, matching how invite links already work, while adding a
  strong encryption layer on top of transport security.

## Notes & limitations
- Because signaling relies on PeerJS's public broker and media flows directly between browsers,
  very large meetings or participants behind restrictive NATs/firewalls may have trouble
  connecting (no TURN relay is configured).
- Files are transferred in a single data-channel message per recipient and held in memory, so the
  25 MB cap keeps transfers reliable across browsers.
