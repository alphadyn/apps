## Quick Start & Running

Configure Supabase:

1. Run [supabase-schema.sql](supabase-schema.sql) in the Supabase SQL Editor.
2. Set the project URL and anon key in [supabase-config.js](supabase-config.js).

The schema creates the public `nexus-media` Storage bucket and its policies. Binary uploads, including videos, are stored there; the `nexus_media_items` table stores their durable public URLs.

If uploads report `NoSuchBucket`, the schema has not been applied to the configured Supabase project. Run it in the SQL Editor, then retry the upload.

Run the static app locally:

```bash
cd nexus
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Open `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser. All uploaded files, property updates, tags, and deletions persist directly in Supabase.

For destructive database operations, open **Admin** from the sidebar and choose **Clear All Files**. Nexus asks for confirmation before deleting every indexed file, and the resulting notification provides an **Undo** action.
