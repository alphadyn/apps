# Photo Gallery

**Deployed application:** [Open the app](https://alphadyn.github.io/apps/photo-gallery/)

> Standalone responsive browser gallery. See the [repository catalog](../README.md) for shared setup and deployment context.

A browser-based web app that fetches 10 new random photos from the web on every page load/refresh and displays them in an auto-rotating carousel.

## Features

- 10 photos fetched live from Picsum Photos on every page load, so a new set appears each time you refresh
- Auto-rotating carousel with a progress bar
- Previous / Next navigation buttons
- Play / Pause toggle
- Clickable thumbnail strip to jump to any photo
- Keyboard navigation (Left / Right arrow keys)
- Mobile swipe gestures to move between photos
- **Maximize photo button** (⛶) to view full-screen images
- **Full-screen navigation**: Swipe left/right to navigate, swipe up/down to exit
- Carousel auto-rotation pauses when viewing maximized images
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main page markup
- `styles.css` - App styling and responsive layout
- `app.js` - Fetches a fresh set of photo URLs and drives the carousel logic and rotation timer

## How To Run

No build tools or installation are required. An internet connection is required to load photos, since a new set is requested from Picsum Photos on every refresh.

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Refresh the page to get a brand-new set of 10 photos.
3. The gallery rotates automatically every 4 seconds.
4. Use the arrow buttons, thumbnails, or Left/Right keys to navigate manually.
5. On phones and tablets, swipe left or right on the image to move between photos.
6. Click the pause button to stop auto-rotation.
7. Click the maximize button (⛶) to view a photo full-screen.
8. In full-screen mode:
   - Swipe left to view the next photo
   - Swipe right to view the previous photo
   - Swipe up or down to exit full-screen mode
   - Press ESC to exit full-screen mode
   - Click outside the image to exit full-screen mode

## Test the project

Run the repository-wide test suite from the project root:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

## Notes

Photos are served by [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos) using a randomly generated seed per image, per page load. Since the photos are fetched over the network, the app requires an active internet connection and will not work fully offline.
